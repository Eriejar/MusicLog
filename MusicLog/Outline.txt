User Workflow:

(D) 3) User checks all artists to add to MusicLog
(D) 4) User listens to random music on spotify
(D) 5) Program periodically checks last x days from last scan of user listens and 
compares to existing data, utilizing new data to mark any songs in the particular album as “completed”
(D) 6) User can also see time and date of previous listens
(D) 7) User needs to manually mark albums / songs as listened to
(D) 8) User needs to unmark previous listens
(D) 9) User needs to delete artists or albums from list
